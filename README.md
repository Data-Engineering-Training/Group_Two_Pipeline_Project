Customer Data Generation and Analysis Pipeline
Project Overview

This project outlines a data pipeline for generating and analyzing customer data for 10 fictitious companies. The pipeline leverages the Faker library to create realistic customer data and explores various functionalities through SQL queries.

Pipeline Stages

Data Generation (Python):

Utilize Faker library to generate 100,000 customer records for each of the 10 companies.
Include demographics (name, address), transaction activity, customer preferences (app, website), and communication methods (email).
Data Ingestion (Python):

Establish connection to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Define database schema to accommodate the generated customer data.
Ingest the generated data into the database tables.
Data Analysis (SQL):

Develop a set of 10 SQL queries to answer various business-related questions about the customer data.
Examples might include:
Identify customers with the highest spending history.
Find the most popular communication channels.
Analyze customer preferences between app and website usage.
Query Storage (Text File):

Store the developed SQL queries in a separate text file for reference and future use.
Data Pipeline Diagram (Image):

Create a visual representation of the data pipeline workflow, illustrating the flow of data from generation to analysis.
Technologies Used

Python (programming language)
Faker (data generation library)
Relational Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
SQL (Structured Query Language)
Benefits

Simulates real-world customer data for analysis and exploration.
Provides a practical example of data pipeline construction.
Demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting insights from customer data.
